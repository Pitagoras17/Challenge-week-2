                    Oscar Thomas was born in 1994 in Torreon, Mexico. He migrated to the USA in 2009. Oscar attended New Mexico Military Institute for High School and Junior College. In 2016, he moved to San Antonio, Texas and completed his B.S. in Kinesiology in 2018.
                    Oscar's professional career started as a Personal Trainer in 2019. He has since helped hundreds of clients to reach their wellness goals. However, since the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Oscar has been working towards changing careers and break into tech.
